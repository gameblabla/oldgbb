    <i>A decent anime hero-shooter that currently lacks content with horrible gacha mechanics.</i>
    <p>After many months of anticipation from some, iDreamSky released the game on November 22, 2024.<br>
    I started to play the game shortly after its release after i became disappointed with Snowbreak.<br>
    While i enjoyed Snowbreak for what it is, a 3rd person anime shooter in a market that had very few of them at the time,<br>
    i was rather annoyed by the fact that they had removed male operators before, and beyond that, beholden to the (sadly) toxic chinese fanbase.<br>
    <br>
    Strinova is no different in that it's also a chinese company but isn't a game that focuses on fanservice, unlike what Snowbreak ultimately became.<br>
    Before Snowbreak, there was also Sword Art Online : Fatal Bullet, an excellent anime shooter that i can easily recommend to other people.<br>
    Sadly, that game runs extremely poorly on most PCs so i'm happy to say that Strinova on the same engine (Unreal Engine 4) runs pretty smoothly.<br>
    <br>
    The story of the game is rather unimportant and mostly serves as the game's settings as well as taking the opportunity to explain the controls to newcomers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>The old world is in ruins and its citizens decide to migrate to a new, multidimensional world called "Strinova", where many "Superstrings" fight for their beliefs and the future of humanity. <br>
    You are the Navigator of this world, a lighthouse for everyone to follow, guiding them to a brighter future...</i> <br>
    <br>
    Due to the plot, you are not able to select characters beloging to PUS as attackers, and not allowed to select Scissors characters as defenders.<br>
    This is quite unfortunate and actually reminds me of Concord of all things : the infamous hero shooter that was also critized for preventing you for using the same characters in a similar way.<br>
    On the upside, Urbino characters can be used on either side. This restriction does not apply to Deathmatch or 7v7 mode.<br>
    <br>
    The game has an interesting gimmick reminiscent of Paper mario : your character can become flat like a paper !<br>
    You can use this to your advantage to avoid bullets, go through tight corners, fly and stick to walls. This does come at the downside that you cannot crouch.<br>
    You also cannot shoot while in paper mode but it's possible to set the controls to "Hold" instead, allowing you to turn to paper as soon as you're done shooting.<br>

    <br>
    It does become amusing the first minutes of using it but i'm not sure it's quite the W that the devs think it is, as it becomes a chore to actually use.<br>
    It leads to interesting and memorable moments however and i suspect they did so to avoid one-sided games.<br>
    This game is quite a lot slower compared to say, Warzone. You must rely on your teammates and attempt to ambush your opponents to win games as otherwise relying on your shooting skills alone<br>
    will be extremely difficult and rarely will say, one player manage to defeat 3 enemies on his own.<br>
    <br>
    There are several game modes available : 3v3 Deathmatch, Escort, Demolition and 7v7 Team Deathmatch.<br>
    <br>
    <b>3v3 Deathmatch</b> is my least favorite for one simple reason : the game instead simply pits you against bots and 3 of your teammates.<br>
    It is an easy way to rank up and train but is otherwise boring and not really multiplayer.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Escort</b> is easily the best one imo : You need to escort a truck to the final destination. To do so, you must stay close to the truck and ensure no enemies comes close to it.<br>
    Team work in this mode is quite key to winning games.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Demolition</b> is also another favorite of mine, albeit a bit less so.<br>
    Attackers's team need to drop a bomb at a specific location and ensure defenders don't disarm it or kill all of them.<br>
    Team work here is even more crucial, and if you're not making use of the game's built-in alert messages/chat, you'll likely lose games.<br>
    <br>
    <b>7v7</b> is basically an all-out deathmatch mode. Sadly i feel like the maps are way too small (way smaller than Escort ones) for 14 players and it just becomes a tight mess.<br>
    <br>
    I'm a bit disappointed there isn't a game mode like Capture the flag or even some fun random ones but what is here is serviceable and a lot more than Snowbreak even proposed.<br>
    Ranked is also available but i'm, to be honest, not interested in the competitive aspect of this game (and cooperating with russian players is like talking to aliens).<br>
    <br>
    Ranked is quite toxic compared to the casual "Challenge" mode, so i mostly recommend that you avoid Ranked mode.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of game modes, you can also buy characters with either ingame currencies or with actual money.<br>
    Unfortunately to get premium skins, it's pretty much impossible to get them the "fremium" way, you have to spend money to get them.<br>
    It's possible you could get some from ranked but given the hostility i faced in that mode, i would rather not do that...<br>
    But i believe that's not even the case anyway, which is very unfortunate. Unlocking characters is also very sluggish.<br>
    <br>
    Apparently, iDreamSky made it this way because Chinese players were able to easily unlock most of the skins and characters during the beta test.<br>
    Unfortunately, this did turn off some players and the initial launch version also removed crossplay. It was brought back later in a limited capacity,<br>
    but only if your ping is under 200ms. For the most part, the netcode is mostly solid but there were instances of the game completely<br>
    failling to respond or behaving oddly in about 3 matches out of 200 or so.<br>
    <br>
    I may have sounded very negative here but i did in fact enjoy this game quite a lot and as of the writing of this, there isn't quite a lot of games like this one.<br>
    It's nowhere near perfect but is a perfect time waster and a decent valorant/overwatch anime clone with cute characters.<br>
    The games themselves usually don't last more than 10 minutes and the game's balance is pretty decent.<br>
    The characters's ultimate skills do really turn around games if used at unexpected moments, something that's not a thing in games like COD.<br>
    <br>
    I do guess though that the healers in this game are pretty weak. Celestia's healing capabilities are minimal and her main gun is some of the weakest.<br>
    Kokona is another healer except she can also revive characters and also heal them up more quickly, she cannot regenerate armor like Celestia can however.<br>
    The snipers like Kokona at close range are extremely vulnerable to machine gun users and secondary weapons are too weak to deal with them.<br>
    This includes weapons like the Stinger (ideal for snipers), the Katana (mostly for machine gun users)... The rest like the Athena gun are simply just bad.<br>
    Each character is also stuck with their main gun, you can only change the secondary weapons (which are quite weak).<br>
    <br>
    Overall, in spite of my criticism with it, i think it is a decent hero anime shooter that people should at least give a quick try to see if they would enjoy it.<br>
    For now the game is only available for Windows PCs (Steam deck is not supported !) but should be available next early year for Android, iOS, PS5 and Xbox Series.<br>
    <br>
    It does remain to be seen whenever the game will last on the long term as competition is heating up.<br>
    Fate trigger : The novita is a big contender but will not release to the public until late 2025, not to mention there may be more in the future.<br>
    Up until then however, this is a decent game for what it is.<br>
